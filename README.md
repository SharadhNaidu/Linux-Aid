## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- No user data is stored permanently
- Terminal history is kept in memory only
- Sudo passwords are never logged or stored
- All communication with AI is over HTTPS

### Safe Command Execution
- All commands are previewed before execution
- Risk assessment helps users make informed decisions
- Dangerous commands require explicit confirmation
- Sandboxed execution prevents system damage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Terminal not working**: Ensure node-pty is properly installed
2. **System detection fails**: Check if lsb_release is available
3. **AI responses fail**: Verify internet connection and API key
4. **Font issues**: Install recommended monospace fonts

### Getting Help
- Check the integrated terminal for error messages
- Review the console output for debugging information
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Try restarting the application
